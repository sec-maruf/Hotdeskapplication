üöÄ Project Description
This project addresses the challenges of centralized data control by leveraging Solid PODs (Personal Online Datastores) for decentralized storage. Users retain ownership of their desk booking data while interacting with a trust-aware system that evaluates desk reliability based on:

Amenities distribution (ergonomic chairs, monitors)

Geographical consistency (country, city, postcode)

Capacity vs. amenities ratio

Pricing alignment with city standards

Built with Django and integrated with Solid‚Äôs authentication and RDF data models, this application exemplifies the future of privacy-focused, user-centric web apps.

‚ú® Key Features
